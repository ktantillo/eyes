eye movement project

Discription 

This project was an introductory coding activity. The idea here was to show how with just JavaScript and CSS a website can be programmed to have live interaction with the user. When this is viewed in browser two eye graphics can be seen. The eyes are programmed to follow the mouse icon of the user around the screen.
