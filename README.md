eye movement project

Discription 

This project was an introductory coding activity. The idea here was to show how with just JavaScript and CSS a website can be programmed to have live interaction with the user. When this is viewed in browser two eye graphics can be seen. The eyes are programmed to follow the mouse icon of the user around the screen. 

How to Run 

Clone the files in the repo to your machine locally. Open the index.html file in the browser of your choice, Crome is recommended. Now, move your mouse icon around the screen to see the movement of the eyes. 

Roadmap for the Future 

In future iterations I would make it so the eyes would react with other inputs, as in, blink when the mouse is clicked.
